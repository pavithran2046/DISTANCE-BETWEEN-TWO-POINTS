# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import the math module
### Step 2: 
assign the values to the variables
### Step 3:

x1=4
x2=10
y1=2
y2=6
distance=((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)**(1/2)
print("{:0.2f}". format(distance))
```  


### OUTPUT:
![output](/distance%20between%20two%20point.png)


### RESULT:
thus the program to find the distance between two points is written and verified using python programminggi
